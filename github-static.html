Tried using jeykll on Arch Linux to make a static webpage for github pages (here). What a pain in the ass of version incompatibilities. Tell us what Linux distro to use github! Be easy enough to spin up a container with Debian, Centos, or whatever to work with jeykell, rather than spend the next week figuring this all out.</p>
<p>Guess I&#39;ll have to learn Ruby for jekyll be a reasonably useful platform on Arch. If I was going to learn a second scripting language, python would be a more likely candidate, or how about skipping the scripting languages all together and move onto a compiled language. OK, I just want a damn static html page, and don&#39;t want to learn a new language to do it! Took me 10 g-dam years to be able to hack together a bash script, and that wasn&#39;t having to learn a scripting language, it was learning how to use linux, and writing it down! There has to be a simpler solution to this. So....</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying the abricotine markdown editor as a test. Seems spell check is obviously not working, and we&#39;re getting off to a really bad start! The top menu disappeared as I was exploring settings for spell check, and this thing did the well known vim trap of, &quot;fuck off newb&quot; on me! I didn&#39;t have to pull the power cord this time, but I did have to delete the config directory, start a fresh instance, read the keyboard shortcuts, and apply them to the instance I was editing this on. So... </p>
<p>I&#39;m off to check out alternatives that can spellcheck and don&#39;t have a vim trap built in! Or read a bit more about how to use abri-contin. I&#39;ll remember the name though the similarity to oxy-contin.<br></p>
<p>Seeme straight up markdown is going to work great for what I had in mind. Just need to find a markdown editor I get along with long term.</p>
<p>This is a bit of recent code I wrote for aurch, cause..., I want to see how code looks in the markdown. This bit of code checks the host for AUR updates.</p>
<pre><code>readarray -t aurpkgs &lt; &lt;(pacman -Sl ${REPONAME} 2&gt;/dev/null | awk &#39;{print $2,$3}&#39; ; pacman -Qm )
if    [[ $1 == -Luhq ]]; then    :
    else
    echo; echo &quot;${czm} Checking for updates:&quot;
    printf &#39;%s\n&#39; &quot;${aurpkgs[@]%&#39; &#39;*}&quot; | nl | column -t
fi
    rm -f /tmp/aurch-updates /tmp/aurch-updates-newer

for pkg in &quot;${aurpkgs[@]}&quot;; do {

        pckg=&quot;${pkg%&#39; &#39;*}&quot;    
    check=$(curl --compressed -s &quot;https://aur.archlinux.org/rpc/?v=5\&amp;type=info&amp;arg\[\]=${pckg}&quot; \
        | jshon -e results -a -e  Version \
        | awk -F\&quot; &#39;{print $2}&#39;)
    compare=$(vercmp &quot;${pkg#*&#39; &#39;}&quot; &quot;${check}&quot;)

    if    [[ -n  ${check} &amp;&amp; ${compare} == -1 ]]; then
        echo &quot;${pkg} -&gt; ${check}&quot; &gt;&gt;/tmp/aurch-updates
        elif    [[ -n  ${check} &amp;&amp;  ${compare} == 1 ]]; then
            echo &quot;${pkg} &lt;- ${check}&quot; &gt;&gt;/tmp/aurch-updates-newer
    fi } &amp;

done; wait

if    [[ $1 == -Luhq ]]; then
    awk &#39;{print $1}&#39; /tmp/aurch-updates
    else
    echo; echo &quot;${czm} Updates available:&quot;
     column -t /tmp/aurch-updates
    echo
    if    [[ -s  /tmp/aurch-updates-newer ]]; then
        echo &quot; Newer than update:&quot;
